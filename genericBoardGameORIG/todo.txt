todo:
	MUST:
		VERSION THE GAME
		MOVE TO JAVA BACKEND
			-make then game run in console then start drawing things
			-have it be reactive on the front end: front end sends pings back
			-make it okay to close and get back in, but with new player info

	game logic
		more penalty functions - more original ones to fit new gameplay rules
			-un-unleash carpathia
		you land on another piece and shit goes down!
			-play a little game and one player moves back if they lose
			-possible nail removal and gifting
		move to a synched java backend
		make animation functions fit into code more smoothly
		change board so it is square pieces fitting nicely together with board drawn inside instead of spaces drawn on the board
			-wouldn't go well with multiple paths
				-jk will go easy with multiple paths - have them connect - defs do this soon
			-easy change for now - actually hard change but will be really cool
			-have dynamic camera
			-make this change after java backend update

	structure
		game start timer

later things:
	zombie game - should be easy, but a bit unnecessary maybe
	second ring of spaces - or dynamic structures of spaces
	adding cards - pretty good on that
	wagering on penalty choices- definitely
	restructuring the spaces graph to allow multiple paths - weighted graph instead of a digraph - neeeeeeeded
	fireworks at the end
	add monopoly elements - buy blue, or white spaces to put rent on
	make a huge board and have players only see the part they're on
		-might be too mario partyish
	figure out how to make it harder to kill carpathia
	need animations out the wazoo


comments to address:

	text arrow is too small

	fix top of topToken drawing
	
	game isnt fun and is confusing without explanation
	
	start space doesnt make sense - replace with any other space
	
	never have i ever needs removal - but at least people saw it
