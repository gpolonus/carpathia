todo:

	CURRENT GAME TO MAKE:
		people trying not to land on eachother
			no rolling, just one move
				rolling later
			move event
			winning condition
			build on events as you go

	MUST:
		MOVE TO JAVA BACKEND
			make the game run in console then start drawing things
			have it be reactive on the front end: front end sends pings back
			make it okay to close and get back in, but with new player info

	game logic
		make most things socially oriented
		need things to buy
		more penalty functions - more original ones to fit new gameplay rules
			un-unleash villian
		you land on another piece and shit goes down!
			play a little game and one player moves back if they lose
			possible nail removal and gifting
		move to a synched java backend
		make animation functions fit into code more smoothly
		have dynamic camera
		have npcs that you meet on space and they hurt/give you stuff
		players dynamically find the board as they go along

	structure
		game start timer
		chat box
		color chooser with sign in


later things:
	adding cards - pretty good on that
	wagering on penalty choices- definitely
		rather have wagering on green ones
	fireworks at the end
	add monopoly elements - buy blue, or white spaces to put rent on
	if you click on another person you get 5 of their coins
		pretty shitty
